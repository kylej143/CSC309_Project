# What To Do?
On terminal:
* cd scriptorium            # THIS PART IS IMPORTANT ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­
* sudo su                   # have to be root user for Docker permissions
* 
* ../startup.sh
*source ~/.bashrc           # ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ 
* ../run.sh


# What about Compilers?
Make sure you are running the server on ubuntu 22.04+
Make sure docker is also installed in the root user.
Don't worry, startup.sh will install everything; as well as create an admin account (admin1, Admin1psss)!
